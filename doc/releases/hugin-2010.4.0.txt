CHANGES SINCE 2010.2.0

This is our third and last release in 2010.  For the first time Hugin can be
considered feature-complete.  A third-party control points generator is no longer
necessary. This release delivers some major new features, integrates some
projects from the 2010 Google Summer of Code, and includes many general
improvements.

_Built-in Control Points Generator_

For the first time Hugin does not depend on a third-party control points
generator.  cpfind is the result of years of ongoing efforts and Google Summer
of Code projects aimed at delivering a 'patent-free' control points generator.
Third-party control point generators are still supported.

Instead of passing an often incomplete and incompatible set of parameters
through the command line, the built-in control points generator has direct
access to all project information and tools.  It speeds up and optimizes
multi-row matching.  It uses Celeste to identify the sky.  Unlike most of its
predecessors it is multi-threaded and takes advantage of modern multi-core
hardware.

Additionally, Hugin now has the ability to save and load control-point
generators settings from disk, reducing confusion and errors due to the
changes in the command line interface of the third-party control points
generators.

_Improved Unattended Operation_

Many features improve unattended (batch) operation including:
* The Batch Processor has been improved and can now automatically detect
projects.
* The Assistant is now batchable as well, so more operations can be automated
and run unattended.
* More robust Makefiles to drive the stitching process (see Refactored
Makefile Library below

_Improved Interaction and Functionality_

Many features improve user interaction (real-time) including:
* Masks have been extended with two new types to support stacks in the Masks
  tab.
* Numeric Transform now supports translation (mosaic mode).
* Photos are now loaded in a background thread.  This means that Hugin
  projects can be used immediately without waiting for all the photos to be
  read.
* The Stitcher tab is now rearranged and with less jargon to clarify the
  process.
* Better compliance with native user interface guidelines on Windows, OS X and
  Linux.
* Hints in the Preview window now suggest improvements.

_Improved Reporting of Stitching and System Information_

* System information is shown in About window.
* Stitching now reports more information about the current system.
* Stitching log can be saved for better bug reporting.

_New Command-Line Tools_

* cpfind is a command line interface to Hugin's native 'patent-free'control
  point detector.
* icpfind uses the different control point detectors and heuristic control
  point detector strategies from the command line. It does not introduce new
  functionality, it allows running the different control points detectors with a
  unified command structure from the command line.

_Refactored Makefile Library_

Hugin stitches panoramas by chaining together individual commands.  The
stitching process is driven by make a tool known for automatically assembling
software not images.  The list of targets and the commands to reproduce them
are described in a declarative language called a Makefile.  Hugin leverages
the benefits of make for the stitching process. Makefiles make the process
easy to stop and start, postpone or continue on different machines and
generally makes everything very flexible and efficient.  If a panorama has
been only partially edited, the Makefile ensures that only those steps that
have changed are computed again.  Make enables advanced application such as
automated stitching and distributed stitching.

With this release, the stitching logic has been recreated with a new C++
library for creating Makefiles.  This should enable better and more precise
control over the various stitching tools and scripting of other aspects of
panorama creation.

_Libraries and Build Improvements_

* Hugin uses the wxWidgets GUI toolkit.  Support has been added for
  wxWidgets 2.9.  It is still experimental.  Hugin still supports
  wxWidgets 2.7 and recommends 2.8.
* Support for gcc-4.4.4 and gcc-4.5.1 compilers.
* boost 1.34 minimum version required.  At least the following boost libraries
   * filesystem
   * graph
   * iostreams
   * regex
   * signals
   * system
   * thread
* Hugin defaults to saving TIFF files with LZW compression instead of
  PACKBITS.  This requires a libtiff with LZW support.
* On Linux/Unix systems, libaries are now installed in a private location.
  This simplifies things for users who want to run multiple versions of Hugin
  simultaneously.

_New Visuals_

Hugin has had the same logo and icon almost since inception.  Unfortunately
the source files have gone lost in time.  Cristian Marchi contributed SVG
files of new logo and icons that are an evolution of the original artwork by
Dr. Luca Vascon. To celebrate the first feature-complete release of Hugin the
project has adopted a new visual appearance.  Moreover all artwork source has
been collected into ./artwork-src.  To facilitate contributions from graphic
designers the generation of the actual buttons and icons has been streamlined
and scripted.

_Other Improvements_

This release has the usual bugfixes, adds minor features, and provides some
more command-line tools for scripting panorama projects.

_Languages_

Many of the translations have been updated for this release.  The project gladly
accepts contributed translations to include in future releases.  Instructions at
http://wiki.panotools.org/Hugin_translation_guide

_Control point generators_

Hugin ships now with its own 'Patent Free' control point generator. You can
still install and configure one of the following control-point generators as
'plug-ins':
* autopano-sift-C
* panomatic
* libpanomatic
* match-n-shift
* Autopano-SIFT
* Autopano freeware version

The project will continue to support the plug-in architecture.

_Upgrading_

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.  If problems persists, delete ~/.hugin or the Hugin registry keys
and restart the application.

For users compiling from source: note that the minimum version of wxWidgets
supported is 2.7.0, libpano13 needs to be at least 2.9.17, and that Hugin
requires GLEW the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library, freeglut the OpenGL
utility toolkit, and libGLU the OpenGL utility library.

See the README and INSTALL_cmake files for more information.

Thanks to all the contributors to this release and members of the hugin-ptx
mailing list, too many to mention here.
