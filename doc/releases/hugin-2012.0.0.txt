EXECUTABLES

Users communities produce executables for their respective platforms.

These executables are then added to the download section on SourceForge at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hugin/files/hugin/

A number of users have built recent snapshots and executables are likely to be
announced within a few days of this tarball release.

Watch http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx for the announcements of binary
releases.  If you don't see a binary for your platform it has most likely not
been produced yet.  Consider stepping up to the task.  Instructions at

CHANGES SINCE 2011.4.0

The lensfun library for reading and writing lens parameters from/to database has now been integrated into Hugin.
Users can now search the lensfun library and load lens parameters.

Added new tool pto_gen for generation of pto file from image files.

Other Improvements

  * Various improvements to cpfind including a prealign matching strategy and pair     wise matching for multirow heuristic
  * Added option to keep exposure fused stacks
  * pano_modify: Added HDR autocrop option
  * Many more improvements and bug fixes.


UPGRADING

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.

It is strongly recommeded to set the default control point detector to
Hugin's CPFind.  It is the only control point generator endorsed by Hugin.
Third-party generators may be compatible with the plug-in architecture.


COMPILING

Users compiling from source refer to the dependencies listed at
http://wiki.panotools.org/Development_of_Open_Source_tools#Dependencies

and the build processes listed at
http://wiki.panotools.org/Development_of_Open_Source_tools#Build_your_Own_Test_Builds

KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS

Panosphere Overview window seperated from the content
https://bugs.launchpad.net/hugin/+bug/726997

There is a known problem building Hugin with CMake 2.8.5rc2.
Workaround: Upgrade to a newer CMake version.

Mac OS X:
- Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) is no longer supported.
- The PPC platform is no longer supported.
- The OpenMP enabled enblend is now compatible on Mac OS X Lion (10.7).
- The cmake compilation of Hugin is currently broken due to the fact that
the boost library on OS X is currently at version 1.50 and boost versions => 1.48
conflict with a number of Mac OS X macros (from AssertMacros.h). This can
not be disabled as WxWindows for Mac (a.k.a. WxMac) needs these macros.
An XCode build, where a specific boost (<=1.46) can be specified, is
possible. The 2012.0 OSX bundle will be based on an XCode build with boost
1.46.

An updated list of issues deemed to be critical, including discussions
and workarounds is in the issue tracker.
