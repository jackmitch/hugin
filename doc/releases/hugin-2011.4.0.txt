CHANGES SINCE 2011.2.0

Hugin has got a vertical feature detection tool for automatic levelling
of panoramas. Beside this also many bugs have fixed and many general
improvements have been made.


Vertical feature detection tool

Often a panorama, created from several single photos, is not level. In
this case the experienced user adds vertical and horizontal control
points to level the panorama.

With this release Hugin introduces a tool named /linefind/ which
automatically detects vertical features in the photos such as the edges
of buildings and windows, and assigns vertical control points to them.
This makes it easier than before to level a panorama, in most cases it
works without any intervention.


Other Improvements

  * The Fast Preview window can now show composition guides such as
    Rule of Thirds and Golden ratio to support an easier composition
    of the final panorama.
  * The output of High Dynamic Range (HDR) images has been modified to
    prevent clipping of the exposure in EXR format images. The
    previous versions of Hugin outputted HDR images with absolute
    exposure values, now with this 2011.4.0 release, Hugin uses relative
    exposure values. This means that the output Exposure Value (EV) of
    the panorama, which can be set in the preview window, has an
    influence on the HDR output (as already for normal LDR images) and
    should be set to the medium exposure value of the images. If you set
    the output exposure value to zero, the old behavior is restored.
  * The batch processor PTBatcherGUI has been extended:
      o It is now possible to directly add unaligned projects to the
        assistant queue for aligning and control point generation.
      o Successfully stitched projects can be automatically removed from
        the queue, this makes the queue management easier.
      o If a project was successfully finished by the assistant, it can
        be automatically added to the stitching queue. This now allows
        for a fully automatic panorama creation workflow.
  * Many more improvements and bug fixes.


UPGRADING

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.

It is strongly recommeded to set the default control point detector to
Hugin's CPFind.  It is the only control point generator endorsed by Hugin.
Third-party generators may be compatible with the plug-in architecture.

KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS

Panosphere Overview window seperated from the content
https://bugs.launchpad.net/hugin/+bug/726997


There is a known problem building Hugin with CMake 2.8.5rc2.
Workaround: Upgrade to a newer CMake version.


Mac OS X Users at Tiger and Lion: this version of Hugin contains an openMP enabled 
enblend and enfuse. These versions don't run on Tiger and currently not on Lion either. 
Please use the Tiger-compatible enblend and enfuse from the enblend-enfuse-4.0 folder 
in this dmg. You can specify alternative "external" enblend and enfuse from the Programs 
pane in the preferences after installing these special version by following the instructions 
in the README in the enblend-enfuse-4.0 folder.
