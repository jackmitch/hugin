EXECUTABLES

Users communities produce executables for their respective platforms.

These executables are then added to the download section on SourceForge at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hugin/files/hugin/

A number of users have built recent snapshots and executables are likely to be
announced within a few days of this tarball release.

Watch http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx for the announcements of binary
releases.  If you don't see a binary for your platform it has most likely not
been produced yet.  Consider stepping up to the task.  Instructions at

TRANSLATIONS

Many translations have been updated for this release.


CHANGES SINCE 2010.4.0

Despite some known issues (see section KNOWN ISSUES below) this release brings
many major new features worth releasing now.  Hugin's own control point
generator CPFind has been significantly improved;  the last project from the
2010 Google Summer of Code has been integrated;  many general improvements
have been made.


_Improved Built-in Control Points Generator_

CPFind's detection ability has been significantly improved, especially for
wide angle (> FOV 65Â°) images, fisheye images, and rotated images.  Anecdotal
evidence shows it to be more accurate than any other CP detector ever used
with Hugin.  A thorough, scientific comparison against other CP detectors
is welcome.  If you have well formed comparison results, please publish a link
on the Hugin mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx/


_Improved Fast Preview_

An Overview pane has been added to the Fast Preview window.  Users can now
interact with the panosphere like in a virtual reality viewer in real time
and visualize all areas of the panorama with little distortion, including
the zenith and nadir that are typically excessively distorted in the flat
preview.

It is now possible to drag individual images or arbitrary groups of images
on the panosphere in the fast preview.

A new gray point picker has been added for visual white balance correction.


_Registration of Stereo Images_

align_image_stack is commonly used for the alignment of slightly misaligned
images, e.g. for creating a High Dynamic Range image  from multiple exposures
when the camera was hand held.

It has been extended with additional functionality for the registration of
stereo images.


_Other Improvements_

* Man pages are now compressed and the generation is integrated in the CMake
  process (Linux).
* New Thoby projection modeling 10.5mm Nikkor fisheye lens.
* Improved support for some keyboard shortcuts.
* New Preferences: output file format (LDR only).
* This release has the usual bugfixes and adds minor features.


_Libraries and Build_

* CMake 2.8 or newer is now required
* Support has been added for gcc-4.6 compiler
* Libpano13 needs to be at least 2.9.18


CONTROL POINTS GENERATORS

Since 2010.4 Hugin ships with its own 'Patent Free' control point generator.
Third-party generators are still supported through the plug-in architecture.
CPFind is the recommended control point generator and the only one endorsed
by the Hugin project team.


UPGRADING

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.

It is strongly recommended to set the default control point detector to
Hugin's CPFind.


COMPILING

Users compiling from source refer to the dependencies listed at
http://wiki.panotools.org/Development_of_Open_Source_tools#Dependencies

and the build processes listed at
http://wiki.panotools.org/Development_of_Open_Source_tools#Build_your_Own_Test_Builds

More information in the README and INSTALL_cmake files in the tarball.


KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS

On some versions of OSX, Hugin can't stitch the project.  Workaround:
1. Save the project file in Hugin
2. Open the project file in PTBatcherGUI (File / Add Project / select .pto file)
3. Click the run button to stitch.
