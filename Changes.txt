Hugin 2018.0
* Several improvements for optimizer tabs (mark deselected images, allow changing
  optimizer variables for all selected images at once, option to ignore line cp)
* hugin_stacker: New tool to stack overlapping images.
* Hugin: Added option to disable auto-rotation of images in control point and mask editor.
* Nona, verdandi and hugin_stacker can now write BigTIFF images (for files >4 GB).
* Added expression parser to GUI: This allows to manipulate several image variables at 
  once. (This is the same as running pto_var --set from the command line.)
* Add user-defined assistant and expose it in the GUI. It allows to set up different
  assistant strategies without the need to recompiling. Provide also some examples
  (scanned images, multi-row panoramas with orphaned images, single-shot panorama
  cameras).

============================================================================================
Hugin 2017.0
* Several fixes for working with HDR images (display in GUI, photometric optimizer,
  handling of under/over exposured pixels in merging code).
* Expose shipped user defined output sequences in GUI as own sub-menu.
* Added some more user defined output sequences (layered TIFF, cube faces) and
  added new placeholder %sourceimage% to user defined output sequence.
* Optimizer tabs uses now checkboxes instead of bold underlined font for marking
  of variables to be optimized.
* Use wxWidgets help windows instead of default browser (Linux&Mac only,
  this provides table of content, index and full text search in help files).
* Added special assistant variant for single image projects.
* Cpfind does not downscale images smaller than 2000 pixels.
* Fixes handling of masks in cpfind when images needs remapping for cp finding.
* Display of final panorama dimensions on stitcher tab.
* Sometimes unsaved changes were disregarded without asking the user (e.g. when loading 
  a project via the recently used projects list). Unsaved changes should now always 
  require user confirmation).

============================================================================================
Hugin 2016.2
* Allow reading of image positions from Papywizard XML files.
* Internal blender and verdandi got the possibility to blend seams as alternative to
  current hard seam.
* The display of the control point error (after optimizing and in fast preview window)
  and the control point list window can now limited to take only control points in active
  images into account (menu Edit>Optimize only active images, connected with the setting
  on the optimizer tab).
* Improvements to mask tab in Hugin (edit crop of all images of the same lens at once) and
  find panorama dialog in PTBatcherGUI (remove images from found panoramas, split found
  panorama into two).
* Several improvements for Mac OS.
* Fixes several issues with fast preview window which could result in random crashes
  (uninitialized variables, memory leaks).

============================================================================================
Hugin 2016.0
* Added user defined output. The user can define own output sequences to implement
  new use cases, e.g. zero noise output.
* Added --clip-exposure switch to nona to automatically mask over and under exposed
  areas in input images.
* Color management
   ** GUI tools (Hugin, calibrate_lens_gui) take ICC profiles in files and monitor 
      color profile into account to display images.
   ** celeste and cpfind converts internal image to sRGB before working.
* Some buttons got a context menu for easier access to some function
  ** Show all in fast preview window to allow better interaction with stacked projects
  ** Celeste in cp tab: the button can now create cp or clean cp  
* Updated internal levmar library to version 2.6
* The identify tool in the fast preview window shows now also the image numbers on top
  of the images. (This can be suppressed by pressing the alt button).
* Fixes internal image format for GPU remapping. This should fix the "unsupported
  framebufferformat" error.
* Use own code for OpenGL intialization. Now freeglut is not needed anymore.
  (This should prevent the appearing of window when running "nona -g". Linux/Window only)
* Control point and mask editor retain viewpoint when changing zoom factor.
* PTBatcherGUI: Minimize to tray is now user configurable.
* Fixes a bug in photometric optimizer and merge projects with line control points.

============================================================================================

  (better support for translation parameter, e.g. for nadir images, also pano with 
  translation parameters can now rotated)
* improvement of the GPU remapping code (bug fixes in the glue code, added some missing
  GPU transformation, now also fisheye lenses are supported by GPU code)
* better support for line control point in Control points tab (it still requires that 
  the same image is displayed left and right for full features, but also better support 
  for line control points above several images)
* obsolete programs matchpoint, nona_gui and PTBatcher have been removed
* outdated translation have been removed from the default install
* initialize the colour balance values during loading with EXIF values 
  (this information is only stored and decoded by some cameras
