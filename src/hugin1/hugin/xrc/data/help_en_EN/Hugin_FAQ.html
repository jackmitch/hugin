<h2><a name="Common_error_messages"><span class="mw-headline">Common error messages</span></a></h2>
<h3><a name="enblend:_excessive_overlap_detected"><span class="mw-headline">enblend: excessive overlap detected</span></a></h3>
<p>This is an error new to enblend-4.0.  Photos that nearly entirely overlap won't blend very well, enblend now fails instead of attempting to blend them.  There are various workarounds:
</p>
<ul><li> Follow the error message and remove the suggested image from the set, you probably don't need it to complete the panorama.</li>
<li> Switch back to enblend-3.2.</li>
<li> Hugin will merge stacked images before blending if you select 'Exposure fusion' in the <a href="Hugin_Stitcher_tab.html" title="Hugin Stitcher tab">Hugin Stitcher tab</a>. This error will go away, but Hugin will take a very different approach to variable exposure between photos.</li>
<li> Mask out major parts of one image.</li></ul>
<h3><a name="enblend:_error_writing_to_image_swap_file"><span class="mw-headline">enblend: error writing to image swap file</span></a></h3>
<p><a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> needs a lot of memory and uses its own swap routine to store picture data on the disk, this message indicates that you have run out of disk space.  The data is stored in the system temp folder which is specified by TMP, TEMP or TMPDIR environment variables, note that this temp folder may be on a different physical disk to your photos and panorama output.
</p>
<h3><a name="Enblend_error:_Mask_is_entirely_black.2C_but_white_image_was_not_identified_as_redundant"><span class="mw-headline">Enblend error: Mask is entirely black, but white image was not identified as redundant</span></a></h3>
<p>This is a well known "error" for <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a>. Try to use the additional enblend parameter "--fine-mask" to get rid of the error. The parameter will result in generation of masks in higher resolution that will fix the problem in most cases. Sometimes the "--fine-mask" parameter may result in memory errors (malloc: ...), which are the result of not enough memory available due to the (much) bigger masks that are used.
</p><p>An alternative workaround would be to set the enblend --no-optimize parameter, this will place the seam directly along the middle of the image overlaps regardless of image content.  This option is also considerably faster and uses less memory.
</p><p>This error also occurs when one photo is completely covered by another, try removing redundant photos.
</p><p>Note also that for the same reasons this error often appears when rendering a scene with extreme distortion such as a stereographic 'little planet'. For this and other reasons, such as overall speed, it is always preferable to render a 'normal' 360° <a href="Equirectangular_Projection.html" title="Equirectangular Projection">Equirectangular Projection</a> panorama first, then load this as a single source image into a new project and render whatever views you need.
</p><p>Note (Jan 2010): This should be fixed in the latest <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> 4.0 release.
</p>
<h3><a name="enblend:_Error_-1073741795"><span class="mw-headline">enblend: Error -1073741795</span></a></h3>
<p>See <a href="Hugin_FAQ.html#Enblend:_The_system_cannot_execute_the_specified_command">#Enblend: The system cannot execute the specified command</a>, in particular if you are a Windows user try switching to the 'nosse' enblend-enfuse.

<h3><a name="nona:_GL_error:_Framebuffer_incomplete.2C_incomplete_attachment_in:"><span class="mw-headline">nona: GL error: Framebuffer incomplete, incomplete attachment in:</span></a></h3>
<p>This is a message generated by nona when using the GPU for stitching (feature available starting with Hugin-2009.2.0). See section below about <a href="Hugin_FAQ.html#GPU-stitching_.28nona.29">GPU-stitching</a>.
</p>
<h3><a name="Hugin_Quits_.28Seg_Faults.29_at_Launch_.28Linux.29"><span class="mw-headline">Hugin Quits (Seg Faults) at Launch (Linux)</span></a></h3>
<p>There may be many reasons why a program dies before it has even started.
</p><p>One possibility is bad configuration or installation of the video drivers.  See this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/hugin/+bug/679427">ticket</a>.  To diagnose, try running glxgears.  On Ubuntu (the package is probably available on most Linux distributions):
</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get mesa-utils
glxgears
</pre>
<p>If glxgears does not run on your system, Hugin will not run either.  See your Linux distribution's instruction on how to fix the video drivers.
</p>
<h3><a name="Simple_user_interface_can_not_selected"><span class="mw-headline">Simple user interface can not selected</span></a></h3>
<p>There are two possible causes for this.
</p>
<ul><li> Cause 1: your computer (exactly the graphic system) does not support the necessary OpenGL sub system. This may be the cause for some simple graphic chips or the driver does not implement the features. In the latter try to update your graphic driver.</li>
<li> Cause 2: you have disabled the fast preview window during the last run of Hugin.</li></ul>
<p>To reactivate the fast preview window and therefore the simple user interface start Hugin with pressed control key and activate the fast preview window again. You may switch to simple user interface once.

<h3><a name="Linux:_Compiz"><span class="mw-headline">Linux: Compiz</span></a></h3>
<p>Linux: Compiz interferes with the <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">hugin Fast Preview window</a>. This is not a hugin specific issue. Research shows all direct rendered stuff will have various problems under Compiz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/96991">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/96991</a>

<h3><a name="Windows:_International_Characters_in_Path"><span class="mw-headline">Windows: International Characters in Path</span></a></h3>
<p>Hugin is fully internationalised and can cope with special characters in file paths. However, hugin apparently fails on some Windows systems with Polish, Japanese, Russian or Czech codepages, the workaround is to use shell-safe ascii characters in file and folder names: <b>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - _ .</b> This includes the path for the temporary folder which is named after your username on Windows systems.

<h3><a name="Non-Unique_Filenames"><span class="mw-headline">Non-Unique Filenames</span></a></h3>
<p>Some components of Hugin have been reported not to deal well with image files
that have the same name in different folders. The workaround is to rename 
your images files so that all image files in a project are unique.
</p>
<h3><a name="Temporary_Files"><span class="mw-headline">Temporary Files</span></a></h3>
<p>Hugin has a preference setting for the temporary files folder. Currently it
is not implemented properly and files will be written in the same folder as
the project file.
</p><p>A partial workaround on Linux is to start Hugin from a terminal with
</p>
<pre>
TMPDIR=/media/disk-2/tmp hugin &amp;
</pre>
<p>A workaround on Windows is to create a batch file which sets the temp folder before running Hugin.
eg using notepad, create a file called HuginWithNewTemp.cmd with the following in it:
</p>
<pre>
REM Create a folder on C Drive called Temp for this to work

REM Set the temp file environment variables for hugin
set temp=c:\temp
set tmp=c:\temp

REM run hugin
"C:\Program Files\Hugin\bin\hugin.exe
</pre>
<p><br />
These temporary files have to be deleted manually after the stitch.

<p>This is a known limitation caused by photos being distorted into extreme 'C' and 'O' shapes.

</p><p>Basically the XYZ mosaic mode as it is implemented currently in <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">Hugin</a> requires that the mosaic photos must be mapped to a plane perpendicular to the view direction - In practice this means that what you are trying to do only works if the panorama is rotated such that the nadir is in the middle of the canvas and not at the bottom.

<h3><a name="How_do_I_straighten_a_curved_horizon.3F"><span class="mw-headline">How do I straighten a curved horizon?</span></a></h3>
<p>If the panorama looks nice but the horizon is curved, there are various ways to improve the image and straighten the horizon.
</p><p>First, try clicking the <b>Straighten</b> button in the <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">Hugin Fast Preview window</a>.
</p><p>If this doesn't work then you can use the Move/Drag tab of the <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">Hugin Fast Preview window</a> to visually straighten the panorama, drag the photos with the mouse, use the right mouse button to rotate.  One useful tip is to drag the panorama so a vertical feature is in the middle, rotate it so the feature lines up with the 'cross hair', then drag the panorama up or down until all the vertical features in the scene are vertical on the screen (holding down the shift key while dragging limits the motion to just up/down or left/right).
</p><p>If it is still curved, you have to add vertical guide control points in the "Control Points" tab. Usually two <a href="Vertical_control_points.html" title="Vertical control points">vertical control points</a> are enough to straighten the horizon nicely. Often edges of buildings, poles or other man made structures provide good vertical lines. To add a vertical control point, switch to the control point editor and select the same image on both sides. Place a control point on the left image on the upper area of the vertical feature. In the right image, select a control point on the lower area of the features, and press the Add button. Once the new point has been added, its type should automatically switch to "vertical line". You might want to switch off the auto-add and auto-estimate options while doing this to avoid naggy dialogs while adding these guide points. Two points that are roughly 90 degrees apart provide the best effect.

<p>Hugin uses the first photo as the <i>anchor</i> image and puts it in the middle by default.  This means that if you shot a sequence from left to right, the images will fill the right hand side of the panorama.  There are three ways to fix this:
</p>
<ul><li> Open the <b>preview</b> window and click the <b>center</b> button.</li>
<li> or select the middle photo, hit <b>anchor this image for position</b> and <b>reset</b> in the <b>images</b> tab, then reoptimise.</li>

<p>If the banding looks like posterization<a class="external" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterization">[*]</a> then this is likely due to a error with estimation of the <a href="Camera_response_curve.html" title="Camera response curve">camera response curve</a>.  To get an accurate response curve, Hugin needs significant <a href="Vignetting.html" title="Vignetting">vignetting</a> and/or <a href="Bracketing.html" title="Bracketing">bracketed exposures</a>. The workaround is to <b>Reset...</b> the <b>Camera Response</b> in the Hugin Camera and Lens tab<a class="external" href="https://wiki.panotools.org/Hugin_Camera_and_Lens_tab">[*]</a> and stitch again - <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">Hugin</a> usually produces acceptable results for a simple panorama when the camera response parameters are all zero.
</p><p>If there is a wave of light and dark patches in the sky this could be due to <a href="Vignetting.html" title="Vignetting">vignetting</a> in the source photos, you can deal with this by optimising <b>Vignetting (Vb, Vc, Vd)</b> in the <a href="Hugin_Exposure_tab.html" title="Hugin Exposure tab">Hugin Exposure tab</a>.  Another workaround is to increase the number of <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> blending levels, try setting '-l 29' as the enblend <b>Command line options</b> in the <a href="Hugin_Stitcher_tab.html" title="Hugin Stitcher tab">Hugin Stitcher tab</a>.

<h3><a name="My_photos_never_quite_line_up.2C_what_can_I_do.3F"><span class="mw-headline">My photos never quite line up, what can I do?</span></a></h3>
<p>It is normal to get little stitching <a href="Parallax.html" title="Parallax">parallax</a> errors if
the camera moves between photos.  The solution is to rotate the camera around
the <a href="No-parallax_point.html" title="No-parallax point">no-parallax point</a> using a panoramic head<a class="external" href="https://wiki.panotools.org/Heads">[*]</a> or philopod<a class="external" href="https://wiki.panotools.org/Philopod">[*]</a>.
</p><p>Otherwise you can sometimes improve things by optimising the <i>d &amp; e</i> parameters
separately - When you optimise <b>everything</b>, unselect <b>Inherit</b> in
the <b>camera and Lens</b> panel for 'd &amp; e'. Also you can open the control point window sort it by distance and check the ones large distance.
</p><p>If these parallax errors are still large, you need to decide which
parts of the scene that you want to line-up and which parts don't
matter.  Select <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a> only on objects that you do want to
line-up and which are all about the same distance from the camera.
</p><p>The remaining broken lines can then be retouched in a photo editor like the gimp<a class="external" href="https://wiki.panotools.org/Gimp">[*]</a>.

</p>
<h3><a name="Can_I_stitch_my_HDR_images_.3F"><span class="mw-headline">Can I stitch my HDR images&#160;?</span></a></h3>
<p>Yes. If you already have merged your HDR stacks, follow the <b>Normal</b> Output on the <b>Stitcher</b> tab (<b>HDR merging</b> is for stacks that will be merged by Hugin). In the <b>Processing</b> step the output will be an HDR in TIFF format.
</p>
<h3><a name="Why_is_my_panorama_upside_down_.3F"><span class="mw-headline">Why is my panorama upside down&#160;?</span></a></h3>
<p>Hugin stitches the panorama on a sphere and can't determine what is up or what is down. Even if vertical control points are assigned, there is still no notion of up and down, so the panorama can flip upside down. The solution for that is to open the Preview window, click on the Num. Trans. button in the toolbar, enter 180 in the roll field and apply. This will flip the panorama back to the right orientation.
</p>
<h3><a name="Why_do_multi-lens_projects_end_up_distorted.2Fbroken.3F"><span class="mw-headline">Why do multi-lens projects end up distorted/broken?</span></a></h3>
<p>You have probably optimized 'Everything'. This will cause the optimizer to try to optimize lens parameters for each of the different lenses, and there may not be a big enough spread of control points for the optimization to work well.
When stitching photos from different lenses, or when you don't have a good spread of control points, optimize 'Position, view &amp; Barrel (y,p,r,v,b).
</p>
<h3><a name="Why_does_my_output_covers_only_180.C2.B0.3F"><span class="mw-headline">Why does my output covers only 180°?</span></a></h3>
<p>Did you observe that the output is cropped at the +-90° borders? (e.g. saw teeth like borders in the fast preview window)
</p><p>Then you have probably used the translation parameters X/Y/Z. This behaviour is a fundamental limitation of the used approach of the translation parameters. It is (internal) working in the rectilinear space, which is limited to maximal FOV of 180°, and therefore also the output is limited to FOV&lt;180° (for more information see <a href="Stitching_a_photo-mosaic.html" title="Stitching a photo-mosaic">Stitching a photo-mosaic</a>).
</p><p>The solution/workaround is to set all X/Y/Z values to zero or to limit the horizontal field of view (HFOV) to a value smaller than 180°.
</p>
<h3><a name="After_adding_an_image_the_focal_length_is_another_value_than_the_EXIF_value"><span class="mw-headline">After adding an image the focal length is another value than the EXIF value</span></a></h3>
<p>When you stitch a panorama the used lens settings are stored in Hugins camera and lens database. This covers the lens projection, the crop, the field of view (FOV), the distortions parameters and also the photometric parameters.
</p><p>When you load a new image Hugin looks up these information in the database and applies them automatically.
</p><p>So when you used wrong parameters in one stitch it can also effect adding images to new project. A wrong information here can also confuse the assistant (especially cpfind).
</p><p>To fix the issue there are several ways: In an existing project you can select reset from the context menu on the <a href="Hugin_Photos_tab.html" title="Hugin Photos tab">Photos tab</a>.
For a permanent fix you can manually save a correct lens information in the database (Photos tab, context menu Lens&gt;Save lens to database). These manually save information will get a higher weight than the automatically saved information. If this does not help delete the database file, when Hugin is closed. You will find the filename in the Help&gt;About screen, on the tab system. But keep in mind that these changes does not affect existing project files. You have to add the image (again) to a (new) project file (because the information is only read from the database when you add an images).

<p>Not necessarily. This functionality is highly experimental. It may be that you have an outdated driver, or that the functionality is not supported on your video card.

<p>It depends on the video card. Bandwidth is mostly the bottleneck, specifically getting the transformed data from the GPU back to the main system memory.
</p>
<h3><a name="Bug_Reporting"><span class="mw-headline">Bug Reporting</span></a></h3>
<p>When reporting success or failure using the GPU for stitching, always report also the driver version, video card GPU and RAM. Tell us what you were doing, the size and number of input images (note that if you stitch from within Hugin or PTBatcher, it is only one input image at a time).

<h3><a name="Why_do_I_need_to_give_2_file_names"><span class="mw-headline">Why do I need to give 2 file names</span></a></h3>
<p>The batch processor needs a project file with the settings how it should be stitch a panorama.
</p>
<ul><li> So you will be first asked for a project file name (extension pto). </li>
<li> Afterwards you can specify the file name for the final panorama image file.</li></ul>
<h3><a name="Why_does_PTBatcherGUI_disappear_after_10_s"><span class="mw-headline">Why does PTBatcherGUI disappear after 10 s</span></a></h3>
<p>PTBatcherGUI does not disappear. Only the icon in the tray bar is automatically hidden by Windows.
Click on the chevron beside the tray bar and configure it display PTBatcherGUI always (the exact settings depends on the Windows version.)
</p>
<h3><a name="PTBatcherGUI_does_not_stitch"><span class="mw-headline">PTBatcherGUI does not stitch</span></a></h3>
<p>In this case you need to check the batch processor settings:
</p>
<ul><li> First check the preferences: on the tab stitching the processor PTBatcherGUI should be selected and the option immediately start shout</li></ul>
<p>be checked. (or press "Load defaults"). 
</p>
<ul><li> Then start PTBatcherGUI (File-&gt;Run batch processor"). If you don't see a window, check the tray area (beside the clock) and open PTBatcherGUI from the context menu on the icon. Probably the batch queue is mixed up. Delete the queue (File-&gt;Clear batch). </li>
<li> Now go back to Hugin and press stitch. After specify the output prefix, the project should appear in PTBatcherGUI and the stitching starting. </li></ul>
<h3><a name="How_do_I_clean_up_the_batch_queue"><span class="mw-headline">How do I clean up the batch queue</span></a></h3>
<ul><li> If PTBatcherGUI is running, select File-&gt;Clear batch.</li>
<li> If PTBatcherGUI is not running, start PTBatcherGUI from the "File-&gt;Run batch processor" or from the start menu. During the starting hold down the control key. You there will be ask to skip the loading of the batch queue. Confirm yes to clean up the batch queue.</li></ul>

<h3><a name="How_can_I_postprocess_the_image_using_multiple_layers_in_The_Gimp.3F"><span class="mw-headline">How can I postprocess the image using multiple layers in The Gimp?</span></a></h3>
<ul><li> Use the <a href="Nona.html" title="Nona">nona</a> stitcher on the command-line, to output to a multilayer <a href="TIFF.html" title="TIFF">TIFF</a> format:</li></ul>
<pre> nona -m TIFF_multilayer -o multi_layer.tif project.pto
</pre>
<p>This will will produce a multi_layer.tif file, that contains all remapped images, cropped to their bounding box.
</p>
<ul><li> Alternatively select the <b>Remapped Images</b> option in the <a href="Hugin_Stitcher_tab.html" title="Hugin Stitcher tab">Hugin Stitcher tab</a>, this will create each <i>layer</i> as a separate file.  Then use the <b>tiffcp</b> command-line tool (part of libtiff) to join them together into a multi-page TIFF:</li></ul>
<pre> tiffcp project0000.tif project0001.tif project0002.tif multi_layer.tif
</pre>
<ul><li> You can also use tif2xcf<a class="external" href="https://wiki.panotools.org/index.php?title=Tif2xcf&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">[*]</a>, to combine the <b>Remapped Images</b> TIFF output into a multilayer XCF.</li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately this requires a lot of memory because it stores each remapped image in a layer with the size of the final panorama.
</p>
<h3><a name="Why_doesn.27t_the_remapped_images_align_when_loading_in_an_image_processing_software.3F"><span class="mw-headline">Why doesn't the remapped images align when loading in an image processing software?</span></a></h3>
<p>By default <a href="Nona.html" title="Nona">nona</a> creates cropped TIFF files for the remapped files. Here only the rectangle which contains image information is saved and the offset is saved in the metadata. Some image processing software (e.g. The Gimp) does not read the offset when loading these images and so the images do not align perfectly here.
</p><p>If you want to process the remapped images in another program switch off the cropped output. For existing projects go to the stitcher tab, select blender, options and deselect cropped output.
In the <a href="Hugin_Preferences.html" title="Hugin Preferences">Hugin Preferences</a> on program tab you can change the default for all new projects.

<p>So you're trying to build from source.  Most likely you have proprietary nVidia or ATI drivers.  They are a moving target and so is X.  On debian based systems including Ubuntu, diagnose with `dpkg -S /usr/lib/libGL.so` and check that the linked library exist (i.e. it is not listed in red when doing `ll /usr/lib/mesa/libGL.so`).  If it is listed in red, check where the library is (`ll /usr/lib/libGL*` is a good start on Ubuntu) and link it properly.

<p>Enblend and Enfuse can be optimized at build time for different hardware configurations. This yields four categories of Enblend-Enfuse builds, with a few variations. If you build Enblend-Enfuse from source, check the build options in the README file. If you download a binary, you can find out how it has been built with the following command:
</p>
<pre> enblend -v -V
</pre>
<p>look for the following in the output text:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Extra feature: OpenMP: yes</b> this version has OpenMP.</li>
<li> <b>Extra feature: image cache: yes</b> this version has image cache</li>
<li> <b>Extra feature: GPU acceleration: yes</b> this version has GPU support</li>
<li> SSE-support is not mentioned, you'll find out if you have an unsupported CPU and the binary will refuse to run.</li></ol>
<p>These are approximate guidelines to help you choose what may work for you:
</p>
<ul><li> if you have a recent, multi-core / multi-thread CPU, you probably want the OpenMP-enabled version. Note however that speed improvement does not scale well, so don't expect a 6 cores CPU to be 3x faster than a 2 cores one.</li>
<li> if you have a recent, fast video card, you probably want the GPU-enabled version.   This is not mutually exclusive with OpenMP and a good builder will add both features to his binaries.  If speed is important to you, you want to test which of the two is faster on your system.  If system responsiveness is important to you, the GPU-enabled version frees CPU resources for your other tasks.  Note that even if your binary is GPU-enabled, the GPU will not be used unless you specify the option `--gpu`.</li>
<li> if you have an old CPU without SSE2 support, you want a NOSSE build.  This is the least performing version.</li>
<li> Last but not least, if blending fails because of large images, try the image cache variation.  The image cache allows for processing of large project when memory is scarce but images are large (and disk is large enough too).  Image cache is incompatible with OpenMP, but a good bilder will make this version GPU-enabled too, so test it with `--gpu` if speed is important.</li></ul>
<h3><a name="Selecting_right_version_of_enblend-enfuse_binary_for_Debian.2FUbuntu"><span class="mw-headline">Selecting right version of enblend-enfuse binary for Debian/Ubuntu</span></a></h3>
<p>At the time of writing the official Debian/Ubuntu package ships with one executable only, however in July 2010 a change has been committed to debian-unstable that delivers two binaries:
</p><p>1. enblend/enfuse
</p><p>These executables are the standard release.  They are using one processor core and the image cache for processing very big images. 
</p><p>2. enblend_mp/enfuse_mp
</p><p>These executables can utilize several cores of modern multi-core processors and are therefore significantly faster on modern processors.  But they may fail on very big images because they are working without the image cache.
</p><p>Both variants can utilize a modern graphic card to accelerate the optimizing of the seam line between two images. To use this feature supply the parameter --gpu to enblend.

<h3><a name="Reporting_Bugs"><span class="mw-headline">Reporting Bugs</span></a></h3>
<p>If you think you have found a bug in Hugin, please report it on Launchpad to help us make Hugin better.  Before reporting a bug, try a few things to make sure it is really a bug.  Then collect the following information and transmit it to the developers via the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://launchpad.net/hugin">bug tracker</a>.
</p>
<ol><li> What version of Hugin are you using?  Consider upgrading and try to reproduce the bug.  Maybe it was fixed in a more recent version.</li>
<li> read the output log.  Are there any suggested actions or messages in there?  If so, follow the advice and try again.  Save the output log to a text file and attach it to the report if you file a bug report. </li>
<li> Attach the .pto file to the bug report.</li>
<li> Use a meaningful title for the bug report.  The line reporting the error in the output log is a good place to start.  Before filing a new bug report, check for duplicates.  Launchpad does already a little bit so.  If the bug is already known, add yourself and you files with a comment to the bug.  This will give your report and your log more visibility than if somebody looking at your bug has to mark it as duplicate.</li></ol>
