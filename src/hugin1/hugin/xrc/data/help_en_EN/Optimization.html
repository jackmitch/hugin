<p>Optimization is the process of determining the necessary warping for an image pair in order to align given <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control point</a> pairs
</p>
<h2><a name="Optimizer_variants"><span class="mw-headline">Optimizer variants</span></a></h2>
<p>The below article is about the internal PTGui<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/PTGui">[*]</a> optimizer. The original panotools <a href="PTOptimizer.html" title="PTOptimizer">PTOptimizer</a> as well as the <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">hugin</a> optimizer work very similar but have a slightly different set of features and internally use different tactics. Hence the results can differ a bit.
</p>
<h2><a name="Understanding_optimization"><span class="mw-headline">Understanding optimization</span></a></h2>
<p><small>John Houghton posted this clear explanation of optimization on the ptgui mailing list. </small>
</p><p>Assume for the moment that your images were taken with a perfectly
positioned camera (no parallax) and a perfect lens (no distortions).
Each image is placed on the spherical stitching surface and warped
(transformed) such that, as viewed from the center of the stitching
sphere, it looks exactly the same as the original scene viewed from
the camera position. The lens fov determines the size of the images.
</p><p>It's then possible to simply slide the images around so that they
align exactly in the overlapped areas.  To enable the optimizer to
perform this alignment, you assign control points on matching features
in the images.  (The optimizer does not "see" the images themselves).
To align the images perfectly, a minimum of only two accurately placed
control points per overlap is sufficient, though a few more will do no
harm.
</p><p>Alas, a real world lens is not perfect and commonly suffers from
<a href="Barrel_distortion.html" title="Barrel distortion">barrel</a> or <a href="Pincushion_distortion.html" title="Pincushion distortion">pincushion distortion</a>.  If uncorrected in the warping
process, this will prevent images aligning perfectly in the overlap
areas. This issue is addressed by the <a href="Lens_correction_model.html" title="Lens correction model">lens parameters a,b and c</a>,
which together control the amount of distortion correction applied.
</p><p>When enabled, the optimizer will try different values of these
parameters in its efforts to get all the <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a> to align as
well as possible.  Note that to enable the optimizer to align the
images accurately all over an overlap area, it needs control points
nicely spread over that whole area - or at least all along the
anticipated line where the blender will position the seam.  If you
already know the optimum values for the parameters a,b and c (from
previous projects), these can be entered via the lens database or a
template or manually.  They don't then need to be included in the
optimization and the wide spread of control points is no longer so
important.
</p><p>Two further factors that cause problems in optimization are object
movement and parallax:
</p><p><a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">Control points</a> should not be assigned on anything likely to have moved
between shots.  The moving object will appear to be in different
positions relative to the background in successive shots.  Clearly,
the optimizer will be unable to simultaneously align the stationary
background and the moving object.  Aligning the moving object will
compromise the alignment of the background. E.g control points on
moving clouds might be nicely aligned, but the horizon then might
become misaligned or bent.  The automatic control point generator
won't avoid moving objects, so you need to be vigilant and delete
points unwisely assigned.
</p><p>The problems arising from <a href="Parallax.html" title="Parallax">parallax</a> (due to not rotating the camera
about the entrance pupil of the lens) are similar. Near objects appear
to move relative to the background in successive shots and so should
not have control points assigned to them.  A distant background will
be largely unaffected by parallax and should be aligned well by the
optimizer. Bear in mind that in the case of fisheye lenses, <a href="Parallax.html" title="Parallax">parallax</a>
effects can't generally be avoided completely:  the <a href="Entrance_pupil.html" title="Entrance pupil" class="mw-redirect">entrance pupil</a>
position varies for light rays entering the lens at different angles
to the lens axis, so it's not a single point.
</p><p>When the optimizer gives a bad result, with large control point
distances reported, check the placement of the bad points.  Try to
account for why the cp distances are so big.  If a point is not
assigned accurately on the same feature in both images, correct it so
that it is.  If it's accurately positioned already, did the feature
move between shots or is it likely to be affected by parallax?  If so,
delete the point.  If not, look for another explanation.  Maybe the
lens parameters are bad or were not included in the optimization when
they should have been.  The <a href="Lens_correction_model.html#Lens_or_image_shift_d_.26_e_parameters" title="Lens correction model">shift parameters d and e</a> should be
optimized in the case of fisheye lenses, but be on guard for silly,
unlikely values in any of the lens parameters.  Be guided by
experience.  You can always manually reset the lens parameters to zero
and try another run.
</p><p>Hopefully, you will be able to achieve an optimization in which the
control point distances are very low (less than 2, say), with control
points nicely spread, and the stitched result should then be fine.
Misalignment due to parallax or movement may need correction in
post processing,  Smartblend<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Smartblend">[*]</a> can often be helpful in disguising these
errors too, by routing the seams around objects during the blending.
</p><p>The optimizer will never change the positions of the points in the
images. They should be assigned on identical features, but the
optimizer does not access the images and cannot therefore know whether
they are or are not accurately placed.
</p><p>The optimizer positions the images so as to minimize the separation of
the <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a>, ideally reducing the cp distances all to 0 when
the points are perfectly aligned (if that is possible). If you have a
lot of bad points and you correct the placement of one point, the
optimizer will change the positions of the images to take account of
this. In doing so, some points may move closer and others further
apart, but the average cp distance should be reduced somewhat. Large
control point distances can be due to inaccurate placement but can
also result from other causes, e.g. poor lens parameters, parallax,
movement as explained in the previous post.
