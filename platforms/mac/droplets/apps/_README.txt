The "BP Progress Bar.app" is a stand-alone application and can be used to display either 
a "progress bar" or a "barber pole"  waiting screen. The "BP Progress Bar.app" is a free
open source applescript application by Bruce Phillips.
You can download it from http://scriptbuilders.net/files/bpprogressbar1.0.html.


The "*droplet.apps" are NOT stand-alone programs. They need enfuse, align_image_stack and the "BP Progress Bar.app" to reside in the same directory.
