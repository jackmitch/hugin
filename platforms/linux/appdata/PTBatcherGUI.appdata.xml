 <summary>A GUI queue manager for stitching multiple hugin projects</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
   Hugin Batch Processor is a component of hugin that provides functionality to stitch multiple projects in a batch queue. Its goal is to make stitching of multiple projects faster. 
   </p>
   <p>
   The process of stitching multiple projects is simplified using a queue of projects. The user can add/edit/delete projects in the queue.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Batch Processor can queue the creation of the final project.
   Hugin Batch Processor consists of a list of projects. Projects in the list are in sequential order. 
   By default, the list is reinstated every time you open the application. 
   What is more, entire queue of projects can be saved and reopened later using buttons Clear Batch, Open Batch, Save Batch. 
  </p>
  <p>
   PTBatcherGUI is installed when you install hugin.
